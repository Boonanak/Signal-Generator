<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A low-pass filter is an electronic circuit that allows signals with a frequency lower than a certain cutoff frequency to pass through while attenuating signals with higher frequencies. It's commonly used to remove high-frequency noise or to smooth out signals in applications such as audio processing, signal conditioning, and power supplies. These filters consist of passive components like resistors and capacitors and are essential in controlling the frequency response of electrical signals.</p>
